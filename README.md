# Basic Machine Learning Task

[//]: # (Logo)

### Overview
- These are useful projects for beginners and intermediates to approaching Machine Learning. Each ipynb file is a different topic (lesson).
- Dependency: Python and some other libraries are listed in each document (ipynb files).

### Implementation
1. Exploratory Data Analysis and create Report (Analytic_Report).
2. Predict house prices using Linear Regression (Melbourne_Housing_Market).
3. Clean data, visualize and analyze flight data (Airline_Arrivals_Analysis).
4. Applying classification algorithms and PCA to flight data (Airline_Arrivals_Model):
    - Naive Bayes
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - Gradient Boosting
    - Support Vector Machine
